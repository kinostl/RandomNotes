**High Concept**
The setting is one where magic crystals are an extremely common resource. They are an infinite supply of "elements". Water, fire, wind, dirt, electricity, etc. The building block kinda things.

The world is extremely hostile and mostly a rocky desert full of incredibly dangerous beasts created by the effects those crystals had on the environment. The only bastion that the civilizations had were the creation of " keystones". Crystals that have been crafted to make a city sized portion of land habitable. To put it simply, safe land is scarce. Even the cities aren't perfect, they're just better than the wilds. 

Thanks to this, adventuring is very much a thing that exists. The average person has no need or desire to leave their home city. Only the brave and foolhearty consider it. Obviously, that means you - the players.

**Non-Player Classes**

*Metallurgist*
Adventurers don't have the time to maintain the kind of setup required for *real* Metallurgy. Even if an Adventurer is an expert Metallurgist, they can't do much in the field. They need their fully stocked forge.

*Team Rocket Dudes*
I'm thinking one of the main "enemy" factions is a sort of team rocket kinda inspired group. A group of royalty that are hiring people to get everything to make a keystone, so that the royalty can live in a gigantic private paradise.

They do stuff like raiding cities, counter adventuring parties, attack caravans, etc.

-

**Big Names**

*Apollo* a team rocket member who is fully aware that the royalty hiring them are idiots and assholes.
> "You think I don't know that? You think I don't have ambitions of that keystone for myself?" -Apollo

-

**Flavor Text**
> *The flameskin boars of the firescape are how they are because they drink water that looks like lava*

-

**Culture notes**
They *love* molded crystal. Its the primary artform. Kinda effects everything, its a good manufacturing method.

**Weaponry**
Magical weapons are very popular. Especially ranged options. Magical pebbles, crystal cast arrowheads, guns, and the sort.

**Transportation**
A lot of adventureres acquire their transportation by assisting convoys. Convoys will frequently wait at the gates of a town, advertising where they're going, and what they're willing to pay for protection. Most of the time the exchange is just protection for free transport. 

-

**Crystal thoughts**
Crystals can be combined. This can be more of the same type, or of differing types. This is the main way magic items are created.

**Keystones**
Crystals that have been crafted to make a city sized portion of land habitable. They require incredibly rare materials to create.

-

**Types of Stones**

**Natural Simple Stones**
**Artificial Simple Stones**
**Artificial Complex Stones**
**Natural Complex Stones**
*C02 Emitter* Creates massive forests that are hostile to anyone that can't breath C02
*Fire Stone* Makes a landscape look like its eternally on fire, and messes with the creatures that drinks its water.

-

**Types of Stories**

*Caravan Stories* Like crystal chronicles, just doing a dangerous errand with a large group with setting appropriate transportation.

- Going from town to town
- Researching interesting areas
- Collecting materials

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

**Wildlife**

__Caused by drinking fire related stuff__
*Flame Boars* Boars that are on fire?
*Salamanders* Like the mythical type. 

-

**Technology**
~~*Cars* Uncertain if these exist. Theres definitely transportation like magic brooms.~~

*Guns* Also uncertain if these exist, but maybe
*Pebbles* Magic rocks that somehow do stuff on impact. Ammo is probably a big deal

**Vehicles**
They are nothing like ours. They are built around the trails that connect towns. These trails are lined with crystals to make the vehicles work without wheels.

*Adventure Bucket* A gigantic bucket that is filled with goods. It has seats built onto the outside, for adventurers. Some really fancy ones might have other attachments like a balcony.
*Magic Broom* This needs a rename. The magic flying staff is definitely popular though, and very often looks like a broom because of just how many stones it takes to make something fly in a reliable way.

**Short           Long            Association**
  Survive         Thrive          **(Physical)**
  Phenomena       Metallurgy      **(Magic)**

So, able to put points into anything up there except `Association`

Short, Long, Physical, and Magic are expensive to add to
The rest are cheap to add to, and most things depend on them. 
Rolls are an X+Y+Z dice pool ordeal

**Classes**
Classes are probably gonna be more like WoDu style feat packages

Phenomena Sorcerer
Weaponsmith Fighter
Itemsmith Sorcerer
