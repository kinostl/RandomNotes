# Your Hand
This Player vs Player mode of NetBattlers eschews dice in favor of playing cards! You will need a standard 52-card deck. You have a starting hand size equal to your Starting Chip Count. 

# Matching Suits Based Hits
As Dice are no longer a thing, you now use cards from your hand to acquire hits! When you would Roll, instead place up to X Cards face down. X is equal to Stat+Skill+1. When you reveal your cards, choose the most common suit in your spread. You acquire a number of hits equal to the Suit Count - 1.

# The Ante
There are two states in this game mode - Reacting and Acting. The Acting player holds The Ante. The Ante is transfered through various ways detailed in this document.

# Drawing and Momentum
Every turn you start without The Ante, gain 1 Momentum. Draw a number of cards equal to your Momentum. You have no max hand size.

# Upshifts and Downshifts
Downshifts allow you to match suits of the same color as if they were the same suit.

Upshifts make your opponent choose the least common suit in their spread instead of the most common suit.
<!--- Upshifts might be too powerful. -->

# Underflow
If you have Underflow installed, you may match numbers in addition to suits.

# Taking your turn with The Ante
When you start a turn with The Ante, your Momentum is reset to 0. You do not draw cards at the start of your turn when you have the ante.

You *must* choose an action on your turn when you have The Ante, as you are Presenting Questions to the Defender. After you choose an action, your turn is over. Leave your cards face down until the end of the Defender's turn. 

## Action Choices

### Pressure
Take an action that would pressure your opponent! This will usually be rolling powers, attacking your opponent, generating your element as a hazard, or interacting wth the environment to create a hazard. Whatever it is, it needs to cause a problem that your opponent needs to react to.

### Use a Chip
Discard a Card, Face Down, to play a Chip. Inform your opponent you are playing a chip. Present its details at the end of the Defender's turn.

If it is Slow or Dangerous, present its details immediately. 

If it is Slow, pass the Ante at the end of the round.

If it is Dangerous your opponent creates a Light Hazard using an element appropriate to this Dangerous Chip if they have The Ante at the end of the round. 

If it is Awkward, you must Discard two Cards instead of one Card. 

If it is Simple, do another action in addition to this Simple Chip.

## Cost Powers
Cost Powers are Simple and require you to Discard a Card, Face Down. This is in addition to spending the Stat Point. Inform your opponent you are using a cost power, and subtract the stat cost. Present its details at the end of the Defender's turn. Since this is Simple, do another action in addition to using this Cost Power.

## Hand Over The Ante
If you end the round with no cards left in your hand, hand over The Ante. Draw a number of cards equal to your Staring Chip Count. You can not willingly play this. This is to force you to play agressively, and cause a natural back and forth.

# Responding to The Ante's turn
If you do not hold The Ante, you do not take actions. You react to the Ante holder's actions and try to reacquire it. This should eventually happen, as the Ante Holder draws no cards.

Start the turn by increasing your Momentum by 1.

Draw a number of cards equal to your Momentum. 

Your turn consists of responding to the action that the Ante holder has set up for you to respond to.
If you succeed at any of these opposed actions, you acquire The Ante.

### Defend
You can defend by making a roll. This will usualle be rolling powers, making a speed check, or making a stamina check.

### Parry
You can still parry! You will usually do this by making a roll. This will usually use a Strength check.

### Parry Using A Chip
When you parry using a chip, discard a card face down. This must be a legal chip to parry with, such as an Impact or Blade Chip. 

### Respond to A Hazard
If you are not defending against an attack, you're probably responding to a hazard. Make the appropriate check. Hazards are usually created by interacted with the environment, or generating element.

# Team Based
Anything that refers to opponent or player represents the team that the target player is part of. The user of the cause of the effect chooses the team member it effects.

Antes are passed from team to team. Teams act as a whole.
