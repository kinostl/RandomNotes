In the distant year of 2012, Florida completely sunk under the water. Miami became a modern day Atlantis, full of those rich enough to stay underwater. They personally fund the city that grew on the water overhead. A city known as "Neon Venice", it is a testament to impermenence.

After the USA removed its twenty-seventh star, it became governed by might. The only law is the one imposed by a private security force. One would think this place a vile place of scum and villainy. They would be right, but not for the reasons they'd think.

Neon Venice is a city that lives on a swamp sparsely populated by mangrove trees. It is built entirely on the back of privately owned boats. Many are small boats, owned by the pet projects of Atlantic Miami. 

Their efforts are absolutely inconsequential compared to the corporate cruise ships. The true nerve centers of everything wrong with Neon Venice. These toppled office buildings belong to the elites of the world. Major governments, Megacorporations, The cabals that supposedly don't exist. 

These ships are the missing millions in every publicly reported account. They do the research and development that can never be admitted to. For legal reasons. For moral reasons. Because it would absolutely topple and destroy them if it was discovered.

Magic is real, and its cost is amazing. Abhorant, immoral. Absolutely out of the hands of the common man. Built on the blood of thousands. Literally crystallized suffering. You are not good people. That doesn't matter, the only thing that does is power, and you'll do anything to get more.

You are the only ones in the way of wearing the world's crown.

I'm looking for 3 to 5 players interested in playing as magical CEOs in my cyberpunk setting trying to take out one another and be the last one standing. Why you wish to do that, I do not know. I'm excited to find out why, and more importantly how.

@Mystic Lillies Respond with ðŸ’° if you're interested!

@ThatGuy74#5439 @Bluberry#5395 @3Birdie#6571 @Jatea#6438 - You will be our competitors.

I may have said Magical CEOs. More correctly - you are very important people in the world. The media worships you as living gods. You own whole countries. You know that isn't real power. Nothing compared to what you can achieve on The Harvest.

In a mere six months The Super Harvest Blood Moon will be reflected on the clear waters of Neon Venice, creating the largest magical circle ever seen. All your research has said that this special event is surely to open the door to the globe's throne room.

Think about who you are, why you're important, and why you've deemed yourself important enough to wield this power despite its immense costs. Think about what you'll even do with it. 

I'm not against team ups, and its entirely possible NPCs might try their luck at joining the fray, but they'll be more of a distraction than a true competitor.

Promises - No Garfield is planned, but I'll be making appropriate pop references.
Genre - Dark Comedy with serious topics. Retrofuturist.
Session Count - I'm assuming like 3 after Session 0, but can see it growing beyond that depending on how our story and availability goes. (1 Session = ~2 Months in game. Exchange rate will change if we need it to.)
Inspirations - Black Lagoon. Evangelion Remakes. 

The purpose of the Super Harvest Blood Moon is to give us a guaranteed end-point, whatever plot happens in the timespan it allows is what happens - I'm not gonna railroad anyone.

Magic - Closed, but high power. Its incredibly unreasonable for anyone to use. It is capable of absurd things. Only about 20 people worldwide can use it, so its pretty well policed within themselves.

Anyway, lets go ahead and plan Session 0 (and likely our weekly play time) - https://www.when2meet.com/?12159309-1h4yX
