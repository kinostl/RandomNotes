In the distant year of 2012, Florida completely sunk under the water. Miami became a modern day Atlantis, full of those rich enough to stay underwater. They personally fund the city that grew on the water overhead. A city known as "Neon Venice", it is a testament to impermenence.

After the USA removed its twenty-seventh star, it became governed by might. The only law is the one imposed by a private security force. One would think this place a vile place of scum and villainy. They would be right, but not for the reasons they'd think.

Neon Venice is a city that lives on a swamp sparsely populated by mangrove trees. It is built entirely on the back of privately owned boats. Many are small boats, owned by the pet projects of Atlantic Miami. 

Their efforts are absolutely inconsequential compared to the corporate cruise ships. The true nerve centers of everything wrong with Neon Venice. These toppled office buildings belong to the elites of the world. Major governments, Megacorporations, The cabals that supposedly don't exist. 

These ships are the missing millions in every publicly reported account. They do the research and development that can never be admitted to. For legal reasons. For moral reasons. Because it would absolutely topple and destroy them if it was discovered.

Magic is real, and its cost is amazing. Abhorant, immoral. Absolutely out of the hands of the common man. Built on the blood of thousands. Literally crystallized suffering. You are not good people. That doesn't matter, the only thing that does is power, and you'll do anything to get more.

You are the only ones in the way of wearing the world's crown.

I'm looking for 3 to 5 players interested in playing as magical CEOs in my cyberpunk setting trying to take out one another and be the last one standing. Why you wish to do that, I do not know. I'm excited to find out why, and more importantly how.
