Welcome, to the media dimension, Tech Lords! High Rez wishes to use the powers of YOUR navis to power up his new mascot - Zap A Trax- and win the mascot wars! Interrupt his spell, save your navis, and go home to your own dimension! 

High Rez wishes to use the powers of the players' navis to power his new mascot - Zap A Trax and rule the galaxy. 

Sally Bookmark has been convinced to dress up as a Tech Priest knockoff named HiFi. 
HiFi has a portable scanner to use as a "science wand". - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1VrGL29HF8
HiFi uses the wand to take photos.

name of the room is "Technodrome of the Cyber Witch"

Random stuff thats cool but obviously not part of the puzzle - Flip clock, boombox, interactive casette deck area featuring a rotating 20-tape machine that plays background music, 8-track, seiko executive egg, recorder watch, magnetic drum storage drum, garfield phone (imported from Brittany, France). 

Cool tech that might be usable - Sony's Data Discman

===

GAKKEN WORLDEYE is able to provide hints in the form of videos. Its placed in the center of the room with the rest of the tech displays. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcG9O6S6cOU

Note to Self - Can use the techmoan videos and have an InfoNavi exist in-character.

A video printer is in the displays and provides the first hint when the Copy button is pressed. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FmzXN_2w1Q

The Game Room has red lighting, purple tables, and green tape on the black ground. The green tape is there to tell players where they are not allowed to pass. 

Puzzle A - Some kind of redo of the Chicken/Seed/Wolf Puzzle
        - Milton, Elektronic, Zeon
        - Blue,   Red,        Green
        
        - Theres three big traks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak
        - They all need to be on the weight plate to turn on the hint
        - They're programmed so that if you screw up the puzzle they all go back to the start.

        - Chicken = Elektronika
        - Wolf = Milton Bradley
        - Seed = Zeon

        - If Milton and Elek are left together, Milton will fry Elek
        - If Elek and Zeon are left together, they'll be shot by Milton
        
        
        So yeah.

-There are three RC Cars - C, W, and S.
- The commands are `Wait`, `Go to Center`, `Go To Start`, `Turn Around`.
- Only one car can take one command at a time.
- The two zones are "Center" and "Start"
- W can not shoot moving targets
- W can not shoot while moving
- If W and C share a zone, W will fry C
- If C and S share a zone, they'll be shot by W
- The cars start in the Start zone
- The goal is to get all three cars in the Center zone.

Intentional obscuring factors

- The zones are presented as an inner circle (yellow) and outer circle (black)
- The cars start in a triangular pattern setup in the outer circle, facing one another
- It is implied that cars can take partial actions. They are essentially useless to take, although creative players can probably find unexpected solutions using the leniency this provides

Easter Egg Solution - ||Move C and S to the center, then move W to the center. It can't shoot while moving!||

Puzzle B - Use the technology in this room to convince HiFi to press a button in an area only she can access. There is a leaderboard for this. (HiFi can not hear the players, but can hear the technology. Bonus for not using a recording device.)
        - In the room is the Seiko Executive Egg, a collection of HitClips, and a litebrite

Puzzle C - Fake out puzzle. They'll easily assume that the boombox is the hint and needs a casette. *No*. They need to find the floppy disk for the FLOPPY DISK BOOMBOX https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ks3ucumilU (The Floppy Disk is hiding in another piece of tech.) [Hint - Crystal ball shows a music File](spoiler)
        - Better idea, its not that its in a floppy disk. Its that its that theres paintings that are actually Recordable Paper to be used with the 3M Sound Page - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdfTuE9XHas

A+B+C reward the players with the hints for the last puzzle, which is focused on configuring the GAKKEN WONDEREYE and the thermal printer correctly to get the exit key for the Teleporter.
        - Is there some kind of key/lock system that actually works this way? Maybe a card key programmer?

###Ideas###
- Fake out puzzle. They'll easily assume that the boombox is the hint and needs a casette. *No*. They need to find the floppy disk for the FLOPPY DISK BOOMBOX https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ks3ucumilU
- Make the biggest announcement. (This could be a really fun one for a PA Machine) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z8z0sbLsrw
- There is a Wire Recorder+Player in the museum pieces, and the wire recording is hidden in High Rez's workshop work table. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90ihiTwJPCc


###Definitely good###
- Make the biggest announcement. (This could be a really fun one for a PA Machine)

###Could be a good use of the background stuff###
- Blow out a candle from the longest distance.
- Make the most accurate and inventive egg timer. You may not incorporate any timekeeping devices. Alex will boil an egg using your timer â€“ they should be runny, but not too runny.

###Random###
- Find out what this gentleman did for a living, but he could only reply falsely.
- Make the best coconut flinging machine. 
- Retrieve a ping pong ball from a tube, without moving the tube. (Magnets?)
- Find the Finns. Each contestant may ask only one Finn a question, which may not relate to their nationality. 
- Blow something substantial off a table. 
- Do the most powerful thing with your little finger.

This is going to be a slice of life kind of session about visiting an escape room focused around puzzles built out of technology. I'm expecting 6 Hours of play time (3 Challenges, 2 Puzzles, 1-ish Roleplay). Low Powered, No Navis, and mostly going to be just interacting with the escape room.

:pager: I'm looking for 1 Player for Friday the 16th @ 8:00 PM (2/3 Slots filled already)
:telephone: I am looking for 3 Players for Saturday the 17th @ 2:00 PM
