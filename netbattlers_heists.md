# Heat

Heat represents your opposition's focus on you. The resources they're willing to bring out. The Opposition always rolls the Heat as if it were their stat. 

## Heat Powers

This is the *only* grace the players have at reducing heat. The GM may use these powerful moves at the cost of heat.

- List
- Of
- Powers

# Countdown

Your window to complete a heist is small, very small. Every pro-active action costs 1 bit of the Countdown. Defending against Heat Powers does not inherently cost any of the countdown, but failure can still lead to Countdown costs.

# Rolling

You only roll when dealing with The Opposition. They're the only real challenge to you.

When you get a partial on a roll, choose one. One a miss, choose two.
- Increase Heat by 1
- Decrease Countdown by 1

When you succeed on a roll, you succeed with no costs. Criticals *increase* your countdown. 3 hits adds 1 bit, 4 hits add 2 bits, 5 hits add 3 bits, etc.
