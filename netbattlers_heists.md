# Heat

Heat represents your opposition's focus on you. The resources they're willing to bring out. The Opposition always rolls the Heat as if it were their stat. 

Heat Starts at the number of players.

Heat 0-2 | Everything is normal
Heat 3-5 | Security is focused on making you leave
Heat 6-9 | Security has been authorized to use force
Heat 9+  | The Opposition's Leader is taking direct action with something nonsense

## Heat Powers

This is the *only* grace the players have at reducing heat. The GM may use these powerful moves at the cost of heat.

The purpose of Heat Moves is to effectively reset the scene with a new framing caused by the power.

# Countdown

Your window to complete a heist is small, very small. Every pro-active action costs 1 bit of the Countdown. Defending against Heat Powers does not inherently cost any of the countdown, but failure can still lead to Countdown costs.

Countdown Starts at the number of players * 2

# Rolling

You only roll when dealing with The Opposition. They're the only real challenge to you.

When you get a partial on a roll, choose one. One a miss, choose two.
- Increase Heat by 1
- Decrease Countdown by 1

When you succeed on a roll, you succeed with no costs. Criticals *increase* your countdown. 3 hits adds 1 bit, 4 hits add 2 bits, 5 hits add 3 bits, etc.
